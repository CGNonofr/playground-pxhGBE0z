# Welcome!

This playground shows the useful, but lesser known, functional programming features of Python. Python is well known for its object oriented programming features: classes, methods, inheritance... However, Python is not restricted to object oriented programming, it offers several very useful features that enables the programmer to use the regular functional programming idioms, such as higher order functions and data collections. These programming pattern may prove useful to the regular Python  developer, accustomed to object oriented programming.

I suppose here that: (1) you have basic knowledge of object oriented programming; (2) you have written a couple of Python programs. If you don't know Python, but know Javascript or Ruby, you should be able to follow this lesson easily.

# Functional Programming

One of the main concept of functional programming is *first class functions*. Simply said, it means that functions can be used like any other data type. You can :
 * store a function in a variable
 * pass a function as an argument to another function;
 * return a function as the result of a function call;
 * make a list of function;
 * ...
 
A function that receives another function as an argument is called an higher order function. A well known higher order function of Python is `sorted`. In its simplest form, `sorted` can be used to sort a list of integers: `sorted([23,545,3])`. `sorted` has an optional argument `key`, which is a function with one argument. `sorted` will call the `key` function for each element and use the returned values to sort the list.

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

 To sort a list of bonus chests in a game, you can call: `sorted(chestList,key=lambda chest:chest.numCoins)`. This will sort the bonus chests with respect to the number of coins they contains. Don't be afraid by the lambda keyword, it just means: "I'm defining a function with one argument that return the value on the right of the column". Lambda a Python facility to define

[`markdowns/welcome.md`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/python-template/blob/master/markdowns/welcome.md)
What you are reading here is generated by this file. Tech.io uses the [Markdown syntax](https://tech.io/doc/reference-markdowns) to render text, media and to inject programming exercises.


[`python-project`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/python-template/tree/master/python-project)
A simple Python project dedicated to run the programming exercise above. A project relies on a Docker image to run. You can find images on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/) or you can even [build your own](https://tech.io/doc/reference-runner).
