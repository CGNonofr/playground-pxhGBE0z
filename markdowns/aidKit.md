"Hi there, please describe your symptoms and we'll try to find the cure !

# - My code takes an iterator and generates another iterator

 \- Right, I see. Our case probably belongs to the [first programming pattern](built-in-higher-order-functions-filter-map-and-reduce#firstPattern).

## - I want to remove unneeded items from the collection
 \- Have look to `filter`. You may also use a generator expression with an `if` clause.  

## - I want to convert the items of the collection
 \- You'll probably feel better with a dose of `map`. If you prefer, you may also use a generator expression with an `if` clause.
